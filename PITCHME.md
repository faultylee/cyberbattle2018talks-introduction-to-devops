### Consumers are more demanding
<br/>

### Businesses need to cope with the demands

---

# #3: IT projects are complex and fragile

---

Customer wants **this** *vs* **minimum disruption**
![dev-vs-ops](images/dev-vs-ops.png)

--- 

## Conflicting demand from

| <h2>Dev</h2> | <h2>Ops</h2> |
|---|---|
| <ul><li>ship more features</li><li>deliver faster</li><ul> | <ul><li>as little change as possible</li><li>maintain reliability</li><ul> |
  
Note:
- dev: meet customers demand
- ops: ensuring minimum disruption

---

![meet-your-target.jpg](images/meet-your-target.jpg)

Note: 
- at the same time dev/ops needs to meet their target

---

![meeting-deadline](images/meeting-deadline.png)

Note:
- in order to meeting deadline
- we might start to take shortcut
- https://creativesoncall.com/culture/news/meeting-your-deadlines/372

---

shortcut = technical debt

![cabling-bad](images/cabling-bad.jpg)

Note: 
- example of technical debt

---

more technical debt

![leaking-boat](images/leaking-boat.gif)

if we're occupied with removing the water, is there time to row forward?

Note:
- if we're so busy removing the water, is there time to row forward?
- if we continue to get more technical debts?

---

too much technical debt

Note:
- what might happen?

# The 3 ways of DevOps
## to be a high performing organization

---

## First Way: Flow

![first-way](images/first-way.png)

Note: 
- collaboration between dev and ops to improve flow
- Credit: https://www.infotechfb.com/blog/the-three-ways-of-devops/

---

### First Way: Flow

![first-way](images/first-way-small.png)

### Business value stream
Value is only created when we deliver to customer

Note:
- before we go further, we need to understand what business value stream is
- Toyota only makes money when customer get their car
- we need to improve the flow of the value stream

---

### First Way: Flow

![first-way](images/first-way-small.png)

- make work visible
- increase flow, reduce lead time - small batches
- never pass a known defect downstream
- deterministic delivery process

Note:
- IT work invisible, measure
- small batches = break product into the smallest deliverable
- responsible for defect
- consistent output

---

large batches
![envelope](images/envelope.png)
small batches
- make work visible
- increase flow, reduce lead time - small batches
- never pass a known defect downstream
- deterministic delivery process

Note:
- fold envelope
- put in the greeting card
- seal the envelope
- stick the stamp

---

![assembly](images/assembly.png)

Note:
- production line

---

### Automation

Note:
- important for DevOps

---

Android Device Fragmentation (2015)
![android-device-fragmentation](images/android-device-fragmentation.jpg)

Note:
- why is automation important?

---

![gsmarena](images/gsmarena.png)

---

![gsmarena-circle](images/gsmarena-circle.png)

Note:
- {ask} number of phone brands in the crowd
- imaging testing mobile app for all possible model
- Cloud helps

---

### Automation = Consistency

---

## Second Way: Feedback
![second-way](images/second-way.png)

Note: 
- Credit: https://www.infotechfb.com/blog/the-three-ways-of-devops/

---

### Second Way: Feedback
![second-way](images/second-way-small.png)

Why do we need feedback?
- would you drive blindfolded?

Note:
- whatsapp blue tick

---

### Second Way: Feedback
![second-way](images/second-way-small.png)

- fast & constant feedback
- amplify feedback loops
- quality at the source

Note:
- reduce wastage
- don't repeat the mistake, positive reinforcement (right thing)
- tackle the problem right away and learn

---

large batches
![envelope](images/envelope.png)
small batches
- fast & constant feedback
- amplify feedback loops
- quality at the source

---

![andon-cord.png](images/andon-cord.png)

Note:
- car manufacturer (won't name) - missing steering or wheel, engine backwards, won't start - tow off the line
- Toyota Production System
- check there and then, not after
- blameless post-mortem
- reduce waste
- tech
  - CD issue, write the test code to detect the same issue before fixing the actual problem (TDD)
- credit: https://caylent.com/devops-deming-andon-cord/

---

### Third Way: Continual Learning & Experimentation
![third-way](images/third-way.png)

Note: 
- Credit: https://www.infotechfb.com/blog/the-three-ways-of-devops/

---

### Third Way: Continual Learning & Experimentation
- short delivery cycle + feedback loop 
  - safer system - allow experimentation
- culture of continual experimentation
- replicating daily disruption
- reinforce learning culture
- allocate time for improvement

Note:
- establish culture of continual experimentation - innovate
- emergency drill
- transparency, collaboration
- do the important and not urgent

---

![chaos-monkey](images/chaos-monkey.jpeg)

Note:
- like emergency drill, but unscheduled
- tech
  - story of all people leaving during a 10am talk after looking at their phone, except for 1, the netflix guy

---

### The only way to survive failure is to fail all the time
- Repetition and practice leads to mastery

Note:
- being able to handle all kinds of possible problems in real situation

---

### First Way: Flow
### Second Way: Feedback
### Third Way: Continual Learning & Experimentation


---

## High performing Organization
- Fast delivery cycle
- High reliability
- High growth
- Bigger market share

---

## Outcome: Reduce wasted IT spending
- improve success rate
- uplift local economy
- increase competitiveness - go global

Note: 
- less wastage = better local economy
- compete in global arena
